# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to introduce myself to the concept of unsupervised machine learning.  Using a Crypto Currency CSV which included information on crypto currencies, their mined volumes, and current supplies I standardized the data, applied PCA and used K-Means to groupit before visualizing it on a 3D scatter plot and a standard scatter plot.
